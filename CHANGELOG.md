# Changelog

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 0beb143: Build with zshy, avoid umd builds

  The TypeScript ecosystem moves fast and I am struggling to keep up with
  it across a lot of projects. This is probably a breaking change for certain
  projects, but not that many. Basically I'm using different build tools.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for commit guidelines.
